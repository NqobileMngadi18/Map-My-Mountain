# 🏔 Map My Mountain  
### A Climate Resilience & Food Security Platform for Table Mountain  

---

## 🌍 Overview  
*Map My Mountain* is an innovative mobile and web application designed for *Table Mountain, Cape Town (South Africa)* — combining *navigation, real-time hazard alerts, ecosystem education, and **food-system resilience* in one climate-smart platform.  

The project was developed as a *hackathon prototype* to demonstrate how technology can enhance *visitor safety, climate awareness, and **sustainable tourism* while linking ecosystem health to local food systems.  

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement  
Table Mountain faces increasing climate-related risks — including *wildfires, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss* — with *over 2.79 million visitors in 2023* (a *56% increase year-on-year*).  
During the 2023/24 fire season alone, the mountain recorded *100+ wildfires*, posing risks to safety, tourism, and local food systems.  

Meanwhile, South Africa’s food security is under pressure — early 2025 data shows *wheat yields down 6.1%* and *maize stocks 72.4% lower year-on-year* — revealing the tight link between healthy ecosystems and resilient food systems.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Provide *interactive mapping and navigation* for Table Mountain visitors, hikers, and virtual explorers.  
- Deliver *real-time weather, wildfire, and hazard alerts* tied to ecosystem data.  
- Enable a *one-tap SOS* emergency response feature using GPS.  
- Educate users about *geography, biodiversity, and ecosystem services*.  
- Link the mountain’s health to *local sustainable-food markets* and eco-services.  
- Pilot the concept at Table Mountain, then *scale globally* to other protected ecosystems.
